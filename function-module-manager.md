`_._ModuleManager_initialize` appears to be calling `_.rd.prototype.Xa`.

The function takes a very long string as the first parameter. It splits it into forward slashes. We'll call each split a section. Each section has the format, "name:value1,value2,etc". There does not have to be any values. Each value is in base36 (letters a-z and numbers 0-9).
